# Sporfbase map markers

Add new icon files to /icons directory for the map. See markers.js for examples of how markers can be added.

It is usually as simple as adding:

{"pos" : [-200, 0, 64], "title" : "Granjero"},

in the text, where -200, 0 are the X and Z minecraft map coords. Polygons are also supported.

If you have a pull request ready, be sure to notify Sporf on the discord server.
